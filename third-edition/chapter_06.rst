Chapter 6: Forms
================

HTML forms are the backbone of interactive Web sites, from the simplicity of
Google's single search box to ubiquitous blog comment-submission forms to
complex custom data-entry interfaces. This chapter covers how you can use
Django to access user-submitted form data, validate it and do something with
it. Along the way, we'll cover ``HttpRequest`` and ``Form`` objects.

Getting Data From the Request Object
====================================

We introduced ``HttpRequest`` objects in Chapter 2 when we first covered view
functions, but we didn't have much to say about them at the time. Recall that
each view function takes an ``HttpRequest`` object as its first parameter, as
in our ``hello()`` view::

    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def hello(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello world")

``HttpRequest`` objects, such as the variable ``request`` here, have a number
of interesting attributes and methods that you should familiarize yourself
with, so that you know what's possible. You can use these attributes to get
information about the current request (i.e., the user/Web browser that's
loading the current page on your Django-powered site), at the time the view
function is executed.

Information About the URL
-------------------------

``HttpRequest`` objects contain several pieces of information about the
currently requested URL:

===========================   ====================================  ========================
Attribute/method              Description                           Example
===========================   ====================================  ========================
``request.path``              The full path, not including the      ``"/hello/"``
                              domain but including the leading
                              slash.

``request.get_host()``        The host (i.e., the "domain," in      ``"127.0.0.1:8000"``
                              common parlance).                     or ``"www.example.com"``

``request.get_full_path()``   The ``path``, plus a query string     ``"/hello/?print=true"``
                              (if available).

``request.is_secure()``       ``True`` if the request was made via  ``True`` or ``False``
                              HTTPS. Otherwise, ``False``.
===========================   ====================================  ========================

Always use these attributes/methods instead of hard-coding URLs in your views.
This makes for more flexible code that can be reused in other places. A
simplistic example::

    # BAD!
    def current_url_view_bad(request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to the page at /current/")

    # GOOD
    def current_url_view_good(request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to the page at %s" % request.path)

Other Information About the Request
-----------------------------------

``request.META`` is a Python dictionary containing all available HTTP headers
for the given request -- including the user's IP address and user agent
(generally the name and version of the Web browser). Note that the full list
of available headers depends on which headers the user sent and which headers
your Web server sets. Some commonly available keys in this dictionary are:

* ``HTTP_REFERER`` -- The referring URL, if any. (Note the misspelling of
  ``REFERER``.)
* ``HTTP_USER_AGENT`` -- The user's browser's user-agent string, if any.
  This looks something like: ``"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr-FR; rv:1.8.1.17) Gecko/20080829 Firefox/2.0.0.17"``.
* ``REMOTE_ADDR`` -- The IP address of the client, e.g., ``"12.345.67.89"``.
  (If the request has passed through any proxies, then this might be a
  comma-separated list of IP addresses, e.g., ``"12.345.67.89,23.456.78.90"``.)

Note that because ``request.META`` is just a basic Python dictionary, you'll
get a ``KeyError`` exception if you try to access a key that doesn't exist.
(Because HTTP headers are *external* data -- that is, they're submitted by your
users' browsers -- they shouldn't be trusted, and you should always design your
application to fail gracefully if a particular header is empty or doesn't
exist.) You should either use a ``try``/``except`` clause or the ``get()``
method to handle the case of undefined keys::

    # BAD!
    def ua_display_bad(request):
        ua = request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT']  # Might raise KeyError!
        return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)

    # GOOD (VERSION 1)
    def ua_display_good1(request):
        try:
            ua = request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
        except KeyError:
            ua = 'unknown'
        return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)

    # GOOD (VERSION 2)
    def ua_display_good2(request):
        ua = request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT', 'unknown')
        return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)

We encourage you to write a small view that displays all of the
``request.META`` data so you can get to know what's in there. Here's what that
view might look like::

    def display_meta(request):
        values = request.META.items()
        values.sort()
        html = []
        for k, v in values:
            html.append('<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>' % (k, v))
        return HttpResponse('<table>%s</table>' % '\n'.join(html))

Another good way to see what sort of information that the request object
contains is to look closely at the Django error pages when you crash the
system -- there is a wealth of useful information in there - including all the
HTTP headers and other request objects (``request.path`` for example).

Information About Submitted Data
--------------------------------

Beyond basic metadata about the request, ``HttpRequest`` objects have two
attributes that contain information submitted by the user: ``request.GET`` and
``request.POST``. Both of these are dictionary-like objects that give you
access to ``GET`` and ``POST`` data.

.. admonition:: Dictionary-like objects

    When we say ``request.GET`` and ``request.POST`` are "dictionary-like"
    objects, we mean that they behave like standard Python dictionaries but
    aren't technically dictionaries under the hood. For example,
    ``request.GET`` and ``request.POST`` both have ``get()``, ``keys()``
    and ``values()`` methods, and you can iterate over the keys by doing
    ``for key in request.GET``.

    So why the distinction? Because both ``request.GET`` and ``request.POST``
    have additional methods that normal dictionaries don't have. We'll get into
    these in a short while.

    You might have encountered the similar term "file-like objects" -- Python
    objects that have a few basic methods, like ``read()``, that let them
    act as stand-ins for "real" file objects.

``POST`` data generally is submitted from an HTML ``<form>``, while ``GET``
data can come from a ``<form>`` or the query string in the page's URL.

A Simple Form-Handling Example
==============================

Continuing this book's ongoing example of books, authors and publishers, let's
create a simple view that lets users search our book database by title.

Generally, there are two parts to developing a form: the HTML user interface
and the backend view code that processes the submitted data. The first part is
easy; let's just set up a view that displays a search form::

    from django.shortcuts import render

    def search_form(request):
        return render(request, 'search_form.html')

As we learned in Chapter 3, this view can live anywhere on your Python path.
For sake of argument, put it in ``books/views.py``.

The accompanying template, ``search_form.html``, could look like this::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="/search/" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

Save this file to your ``mysite/templates`` directory you created in Chapter
3, or you can create a new folder ``books/templates``. Just make sure you have
``'APP_DIRS'`` in your settings file set to ``True``.

The URLpattern in ``urls.py`` could look like this::

    from books import views

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        url(r'^search-form/$', views.search_form),
        # ...
    ]

(Note that we're importing the ``views`` module directly, instead of something
like ``from mysite.views import search_form``, because the former is less
verbose. We'll cover this importing approach in more detail in Chapter 7.)

Now, if you run the ``runserver`` and visit
``http://127.0.0.1:8000/search-form/``, you'll see the search interface. Simple
enough.

Try submitting the form, though, and you'll get a Django 404 error. The form
points to the URL ``/search/``, which hasn't yet been implemented. Let's fix
that with a second view function::

    # urls.py

    urlpatterns = [ 
        # ...
        url(r'^search-form/$', views.search_form),
        url(r'^search/$', views.search),
        # ...
    ]

    # books/views.py

    from django.http import HttpResponse

    # ...

    def search(request):
        if 'q' in request.GET:
            message = 'You searched for: %r' % request.GET['q']
        else:
            message = 'You submitted an empty form.'
        return HttpResponse(message)

For the moment, this merely displays the user's search term, so we can make
sure the data is being submitted to Django properly, and so you can get a feel
for how the search term flows through the system. In short:

1. The HTML ``<form>`` defines a variable ``q``. When it's submitted, the
   value of ``q`` is sent via ``GET`` (``method="get"``) to the URL
   ``/search/``.

2. The Django view that handles the URL ``/search/`` (``search()``) has
   access to the ``q`` value in ``request.GET``.

An important thing to point out here is that we explicitly check that ``'q'``
exists in ``request.GET``. As we pointed out in the ``request.META`` section
above, you shouldn't trust anything submitted by users or even assume that
they've submitted anything in the first place. If we didn't add this check, any
submission of an empty form would raise ``KeyError`` in the view::

    # BAD!
    def bad_search(request):
        # The following line will raise KeyError if 'q' hasn't
        # been submitted!
        message = 'You searched for: %r' % request.GET['q']
        return HttpResponse(message)

.. admonition:: Query string parameters

    Because ``GET`` data is passed in the query string (e.g.,
    ``/search/?q=django``), you can use ``request.GET`` to access query string
    variables. In Chapter 2's introduction of Django's URLconf system, we
    compared Django's pretty URLs to more traditional PHP/Java URLs such as
    ``/time/plus?hours=3`` and said we'd show you how to do the latter in
    Chapter 6. Now you know how to access query string parameters in your
    views (like ``hours=3`` in this example) -- use ``request.GET``.

``POST`` data works the same way as ``GET`` data -- just use ``request.POST``
instead of ``request.GET``. What's the difference between ``GET`` and ``POST``?
Use ``GET`` when the act of submitting the form is just a request to "get"
data. Use ``POST`` whenever the act of submitting the form will have some side
effect -- *changing* data, or sending an e-mail, or something else that's
beyond simple *display* of data. In our book-search example, we're using
``GET`` because the query doesn't change any data on our server. (See
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html if you want to learn more
about ``GET`` and ``POST``.)

Now that we've verified ``request.GET`` is being passed in properly, let's hook
the user's search query into our book database (again, in ``views.py``)::

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from books.models import Book

    def search(request):
        if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:
            q = request.GET['q']
            books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
            return render(request, 'search_results.html',
                {'books': books, 'query': q})
        else:
            return HttpResponse('Please submit a search term.')

A couple of notes on what we did here:

* Aside from checking that ``'q'`` exists in ``request.GET``, we also make
  sure that ``request.GET['q']`` is a non-empty value before passing it to
  the database query.

* We're using ``Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)`` to query our
  book table for all books whose title includes the given submission. The
  ``icontains`` is a lookup type (as explained in Chapter 4 and Appendix
  B), and the statement can be roughly translated as "Get the books whose
  title contains ``q``, without being case-sensitive."

  This is a very simple way to do a book search. We wouldn't recommend
  using a simple ``icontains`` query on a large production database, as
  it can be slow. (In the real world, you'd want to use a custom search
  system of some sort. Search the Web for *open-source full-text search*
  to get an idea of the possibilities.)

* We pass ``books``, a list of ``Book`` objects, to the template. The
  ``search_results.html`` file might include something like
  this::

      <html>
        <head>
            <title>Book Search</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>You searched for: <strong>{{ query }}</strong></p>

          {% if books %}
              <p>Found {{ books|length }} book{{ books|pluralize }}.</p>
              <ul>
                  {% for book in books %}
                  <li>{{ book.title }}</li>
                  {% endfor %}
              </ul>
          {% else %}
              <p>No books matched your search criteria.</p>
          {% endif %}

        </body>
      </html>

  Note usage of the ``pluralize`` template filter, which outputs an "s"
  if appropriate, based on the number of books found.

Improving Our Simple Form-Handling Example
==========================================

As in previous chapters, we've shown you the simplest thing that could possibly
work. Now we'll point out some problems and show you how to improve it.

First, our ``search()`` view's handling of an empty query is poor -- we're just
displaying a ``"Please submit a search term."`` message, requiring the user to
hit the browser's back button. This is horrid and unprofessional, and if you
ever actually implement something like this in the wild, your Django privileges
will be revoked.

It would be much better to redisplay the form, with an error above it, so that
the user can try again immediately. The easiest way to do that would be to
render the template again, like this:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from books.models import Book

    def search_form(request):
        return render(request, 'search_form.html')

    def search(request):
        if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:
            q = request.GET['q']
            books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
            return render(request, 'search_results.html',
                {'books': books, 'query': q})
        else:
            **return render(request, 'search_form.html', {'error': True})**

(Note that we've included ``search_form()`` here so you can see both views in
one place.)

Here, we've improved ``search()`` to render the ``search_form.html`` template
again, if the query is empty. And because we need to display an error message
in that template, we pass a template variable. Now we can edit
``search_form.html`` to check for the ``error`` variable:

.. parsed-literal::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        **{% if error %}**
            **<p style="color: red;">Please submit a search term.</p>**
        **{% endif %}**
        <form action="/search/" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

We can still use this template from our original view, ``search_form()``,
because ``search_form()`` doesn't pass ``error`` to the template -- so the
error message won't show up in that case.

With this change in place, it's a better application, but it now begs the
question: is a dedicated ``search_form()`` view really necessary? As it stands,
a request to the URL ``/search/`` (without any ``GET`` parameters) will display
the empty form (but with an error). We can remove the ``search_form()`` view,
along with its associated URLpattern, as long as we change ``search()`` to
hide the error message when somebody visits ``/search/`` with no ``GET``
parameters::

    def search(request):
        error = False
        if 'q' in request.GET:
            q = request.GET['q']
            if not q:
                error = True
            else:
                books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
                return render(request, 'search_results.html',
                    {'books': books, 'query': q})
        return render(request, 'search_form.html',
            {'error': error})

In this updated view, if a user visits ``/search/`` with no ``GET`` parameters,
he'll see the search form with no error message. If a user submits the form
with an empty value for ``'q'``, he'll see the search form *with* an error
message. And, finally, if a user submits the form with a non-empty value for
``'q'``, he'll see the search results.

We can make one final improvement to this application, to remove a bit of
redundancy. Now that we've rolled the two views and URLs into one and
``/search/`` handles both search-form display and result display, the HTML
``<form>`` in ``search_form.html`` doesn't have to hard-code a URL. Instead
of this::

    <form action="/search/" method="get">

It can be changed to this::

    <form action="" method="get">

The ``action=""`` means "Submit the form to the same URL as the current page."
With this change in place, you won't have to remember to change the ``action``
if you ever hook the ``search()`` view to another URL.

Simple validation
=================

Our search example is still reasonably simple, particularly in terms of its
data validation; we're merely checking to make sure the search query isn't
empty. Many HTML forms include a level of validation that's more complex than
making sure the value is non-empty. We've all seen the error messages on Web
sites:

* "Please enter a valid e-mail address. 'foo' is not an e-mail address."
* "Please enter a valid five-digit U.S. ZIP code. '123' is not a ZIP code."
* "Please enter a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD."
* "Please enter a password that is at least 8 characters long and contains
  at least one number."

.. admonition:: A note on JavaScript validation

    This is beyond the scope of this book, but you can use JavaScript to
    validate data on the client side, directly in the browser. But be warned:
    even if you do this, you *must* validate data on the server side, too. Some
    people have JavaScript turned off, and some malicious users might submit
    raw, unvalidated data directly to your form handler to see whether they can
    cause mischief.

    There's nothing you can do about this, other than *always* validate
    user-submitted data server-side (i.e., in your Django views). You should
    think of JavaScript validation as a bonus usability feature, not as your
    only means of validating.

Let's tweak our ``search()`` view so that it validates that the search term is
less than or equal to 20 characters long. (For sake of example, let's say
anything longer than that might make the query too slow.) How might we do that?
The simplest possible thing would be to embed the logic directly in the view,
like this:

.. parsed-literal::

    def search(request):
        error = False
        if 'q' in request.GET:
            q = request.GET['q']
            if not q:
                error = True
            **elif len(q) > 20:**
                **error = True**
            else:
                books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
                return render(request, 'search_results.html',
                    {'books': books, 'query': q})
        return render(request, 'search_form.html',
            {'error': error})

Now, if you try submitting a search query greater than 20 characters long,
it won't let you search; you'll get an error message. But that error message
in ``search_form.html`` currently says ``"Please submit a search term."`` --
so we'll have to change it to be accurate for both cases:

.. parsed-literal::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% if error %}
            <p style="color: red;">Please submit a search term 20 characters or shorter.</p>
        {% endif %}
        <form action="/search/" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

There's something ugly about this. Our one-size-fits-all error message is
potentially confusing. Why should the error message for an empty form
submission mention anything about a 20-character limit? Error messages should
be specific, unambiguous and not confusing.

The problem is in the fact that we're using a simple boolean value for
``error``, whereas we should be using a *list* of error message strings. Here's
how we might fix that:

.. parsed-literal::

    def search(request):
        **errors = []**
        if 'q' in request.GET:
            q = request.GET['q']
            if not q:
                **errors.append('Enter a search term.')**
            elif len(q) > 20:
                **errors.append('Please enter at most 20 characters.')**
            else:
                books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
                return render(request, 'search_results.html',
                    {'books': books, 'query': q})
        return render(request, 'search_form.html',
            {**'errors': errors**})

Then, we need make a small tweak to the ``search_form.html`` template to
reflect that it's now passed an ``errors`` list instead of an ``error`` boolean
value:

.. parsed-literal::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        **{% if errors %}**
            **<ul>**
                **{% for error in errors %}**
                **<li>{{ error }}</li>**
                **{% endfor %}**
            **</ul>**
        **{% endif %}**
        <form action="/search/" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

Making a Contact Form
=====================

Although we iterated over the book search form example several times and
improved it nicely, it's still fundamentally simple: just a single field,
``'q'``. As forms get more complex, we have to repeat the above steps over and
over again for each form field we use. This introduces a lot of cruft and a
lot of opportunities for human error. Lucky for us, the Django developers
thought of this and built into Django a higher-level library that handles
form- and validation-related tasks.

Your First Form Class
---------------------

Django comes with a form library, called ``django.forms``, that handles many of
the issues we've been exploring this chapter -- from HTML form display to
validation. Let's dive in and rework our contact form application using the
Django forms framework.

The primary way to use the forms framework is to define a ``Form`` class for
each HTML ``<form>`` you're dealing with. In our case, we only have one
``<form>``, so we'll have one ``Form`` class. This class can live anywhere you
want -- including directly in your ``views.py`` file -- but community
convention is to keep ``Form`` classes in a separate file called ``forms.py``.
Create this file in the same directory as your ``mysite/views.py``, and enter the
following::

    from django import forms

    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField()
        email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
        message = forms.CharField()

This is pretty intuitive, and it's similar to Django's model syntax. Each field
in the form is represented by a type of ``Field`` class -- ``CharField`` and
``EmailField`` are the only types of fields used here -- as attributes of a
``Form`` class. Each field is required by default, so to make ``email``
optional, we specify ``required=False``.

Let's hop into the Python interactive interpreter and see what this class can
do. The first thing it can do is display itself as HTML::

    >>> from mysite.forms import ContactForm
    >>> f = ContactForm()
    >>> print(f)
    <tr><th><label for="id_subject">Subject:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="subject" id="id_subject" /></td></tr>
    <tr><th><label for="id_email">Email:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="email" id="id_email" /></td></tr>
    <tr><th><label for="id_message">Message:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="message" id="id_message" /></td></tr>

Django adds a label to each field, along with ``<label>`` tags for
accessibility. The idea is to make the default behavior as optimal as possible.

This default output is in the format of an HTML ``<table>``, but there are a
few other built-in outputs::

    >>> print(f.as_ul())
    <li><label for="id_subject">Subject:</label> <input type="text" name="subject" id="id_subject" /></li>
    <li><label for="id_email">Email:</label> <input type="text" name="email" id="id_email" /></li>
    <li><label for="id_message">Message:</label> <input type="text" name="message" id="id_message" /></li>
    >>> print(f.as_p())
    <p><label for="id_subject">Subject:</label> <input type="text" name="subject" id="id_subject" /></p>
    <p><label for="id_email">Email:</label> <input type="text" name="email" id="id_email" /></p>
    <p><label for="id_message">Message:</label> <input type="text" name="message" id="id_message" /></p>

Note that the opening and closing ``<table>``, ``<ul>`` and ``<form>`` tags
aren't included in the output, so that you can add any additional rows and
customization if necessary.

These methods are just shortcuts for the common case of "display the entire
form." You can also display the HTML for a particular field::

    >>> print(f['subject'])
    <input id="id_subject" name="subject" type="text" />
    >>> print f['message']
    <input id="id_message" name="message" type="text" />

The second thing ``Form`` objects can do is validate data. To validate data,
create a new ``Form`` object and pass it a dictionary of data that maps field
names to data::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'email': 'adrian@example.com', 'message': 'Nice site!'})

Once you've associated data with a ``Form`` instance, you've created a "bound"
form::

    >>> f.is_bound
    True

Call the ``is_valid()`` method on any bound ``Form`` to find out whether its
data is valid. We've passed a valid value for each field, so the ``Form`` in
its entirety is valid::

    >>> f.is_valid()
    True

If we don't pass the ``email`` field, it's still valid, because we've specified
``required=False`` for that field::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'message': 'Nice site!'})
    >>> f.is_valid()
    True

But, if we leave off either ``subject`` or ``message``, the ``Form`` is no
longer valid::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello'})
    >>> f.is_valid()
    False
    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'message': ''})
    >>> f.is_valid()
    False

You can drill down to get field-specific error messages::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'message': ''})
    >>> f['message'].errors
    ['This field is required.']
    >>> f['subject'].errors
    []
    >>> f['email'].errors
    []

Each bound ``Form`` instance has an ``errors`` attribute that gives you a
dictionary mapping field names to error-message lists::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'message': ''})
    >>> f.errors
    {'message': ['This field is required.']}

Finally, for ``Form`` instances whose data has been found to be valid, a
``cleaned_data`` attribute is available. This is a dictionary of the
submitted data, "cleaned up." Django's forms framework not only validates
data, it cleans it up by converting values to the appropriate Python types::

    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'Hello', 'email': 'adrian@example.com',
    'message': 'Nice site!'}) 
    >>> f.is_valid() True 
    >>> f.cleaned_data
    {'message': 'Nice site!', 'email': 'adrian@example.com', 'subject':
    'Hello'}

Our contact form only deals with strings, which are "cleaned" into string
objects -- but if we were to use an ``IntegerField`` or ``DateField``, the
forms framework would ensure that ``cleaned_data`` used proper Python
integers or ``datetime.date`` objects for the given fields.

Tying Form Objects Into Views
=============================

Our contact form is not much good to us unless we have some way of displaying
it to the user. To do this, we need to first update our ``mysite/views``::

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from mysite.forms import ContactForm
    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.core.mail import send_mail

    # ...

    def contact(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = ContactForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                cd = form.cleaned_data
                send_mail(
                    cd['subject'],
                    cd['message'],
                    cd.get('email', 'noreply@example.com'),
                    ['siteowner@example.com'],
                )
                return HttpResponseRedirect('/contact/thanks/')
        else:
            form = ContactForm()
        return render(request, 'contact_form.html', {'form': form})

Next, we have to create our contact form (save this to ``mysite/templates``)::

    # contact_form.html

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Contact us</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Contact us</h1>

        {% if form.errors %}
            <p style="color: red;">
                Please correct the error{{ form.errors|pluralize }} below.
            </p>
        {% endif %}

        <form action="" method="post">
            <table>
                {{ form.as_table }}
            </table>
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

And finally, we need to change our ``urls.py`` to display our contact form at
``/contact/``.

.. parsed-literal::
    # ...
    from mysite.views import hello, current_datetime, hours_ahead, **contact**
    
    urlpatterns = [
        
        # ...
        
        **url(r'^contact/$', contact),**
   ] 


Since we're creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data),
we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don't have
to worry too hard, because Django comes with a very easy-to-use system for 
protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal 
URLs should use the ``{% csrf_token %}`` template tag. More details about 
``{% csrf_token %}`` can be found in Chapter 21.


Try running this locally. Load the form, submit it with none of the fields
filled out, submit it with an invalid e-mail address, then finally submit it
with valid data. (Of course, unless you have configured a mail-server, you
will get a ``ConnectionRefusedError`` when ``send_mail()`` is called, but
that's another issue.)

Finally, if you are feeling clever enough to configure a mail-server (Appendix
H shows you how to do this), you will need to write the view at
``contact/thanks``.

Changing How Fields Are Rendered
================================

Probably the first thing you'll notice when you render this form locally is
that the ``message`` field is displayed as an ``<input type="text">``, and it
ought to be a ``<textarea>``. We can fix that by setting the field's *widget*:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django import forms

    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField()
        email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
        message = forms.CharField(**widget=forms.Textarea**)

The forms framework separates out the presentation logic for each field into a
set of widgets. Each field type has a default widget, but you can easily
override the default, or provide a custom widget of your own.

Think of the ``Field`` classes as representing *validation logic*, while
widgets represent *presentation logic*.

Setting a Maximum Length
========================

One of the most common validation needs is to check that a field is of a
certain size. For good measure, we should improve our ``ContactForm`` to limit
the ``subject`` to 100 characters. To do that, just supply a ``max_length`` to
the ``CharField``, like this:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django import forms

    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField(**max_length=100**)
        email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
        message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

An optional ``min_length`` argument is also available.

Setting Initial Values
======================

As an improvement to this form, let's add an *initial value* for the
``subject`` field: ``"I love your site!"`` (A little power of suggestion can't
hurt.) To do this, we can use the ``initial`` argument when we create a
``Form`` instance:

.. parsed-literal::

    def contact(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = ContactForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                cd = form.cleaned_data
                send_mail(
                    cd['subject'],
                    cd['message'],
                    cd.get('email', 'noreply@example.com'),
                    ['siteowner@example.com'],
                )
                return HttpResponseRedirect('/contact/thanks/')
        else:
            form = ContactForm(
                **initial={'subject': 'I love your site!'}**
            )
        return render(request, 'contact_form.html', {'form': form})

Now, the ``subject`` field will be displayed prepopulated with that kind
statement.

Note that there is a difference between passing *initial* data and passing
data that *binds* the form. The biggest difference is that if you're just
passing *initial* data, then the form will be *unbound*, which means it won't
have any error messages.

Custom Validation Rules
=======================

Imagine we've launched our feedback form, and the e-mails have started tumbling
in. There's just one problem: some of the submitted messages are just one or
two words, which isn't long enough for us to make sense of. We decide to adopt
a new validation policy: four words or more, please.

There are a number of ways to hook custom validation into a Django form. If our
rule is something we will reuse again and again, we can create a custom field
type. Most custom validations are one-off affairs, though, and can be tied
directly to the ``Form`` class.

We want additional validation on the ``message`` field, so we add a
``clean_message()`` method to our ``Form`` class:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django import forms

    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
        email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
        message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

        def clean_message(self):
            message = self.cleaned_data['message']
            num_words = len(message.split())
            if num_words < 4:
                raise forms.ValidationError("Not enough words!")
            return message

Django's form system automatically looks for any method whose name starts with
``clean_`` and ends with the name of a field. If any such method exists, it's
called during validation.

Specifically, the ``clean_message()`` method will be called *after* the default
validation logic for a given field (in this case, the validation logic for a
required ``CharField``). Because the field data has already been partially
processed, we pull it out of ``self.cleaned_data``. Also, we don't have to
worry about checking that the value exists and is non-empty; that's done by the
default validator.

We naively use a combination of ``len()`` and ``split()`` to count the number
of words. If the user has entered too few words, we raise a
``forms.ValidationError``. The string attached to this exception will be
displayed to the user as an item in the error list.

It's important that we explicitly return the cleaned value for the field at the
end of the method. This allows us to modify the value (or convert it to a
different Python type) within our custom validation method. If we forget the
return statement, then ``None`` will be returned, and the original value will
be lost.

For more on Django's validation tools, see Appendix H.

Specifying labels
=================

By default, the labels on Django's auto-generated form HTML are created by
replacing underscores with spaces and capitalizing the first letter -- so the
label for the ``email`` field is ``"Email"``. (Sound familiar? It's the same
simple algorithm that Django's models use to calculate default ``verbose_name``
values for fields. We covered this in Chapter 4.)

But, as with Django's models, we can customize the label for a given field.
Just use ``label``, like so:

.. parsed-literal::

    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
        email = forms.EmailField(required=False, **label='Your e-mail address'**)
        message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

Customizing Form Design
=======================

Our ``contact_form.html`` template uses ``{{ form.as_table }}`` to display the
form, but we can display the form in other ways to get more granular control
over display.

The quickest way to customize forms' presentation is with CSS. Error lists, in
particular, could do with some visual enhancement, and the auto-generated error
lists use ``<ul class="errorlist">`` precisely so that you can target them with
CSS. The following CSS really makes our errors stand out::

    <style type="text/css">
        ul.errorlist {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
        .errorlist li {
            background-color: red;
            color: white;
            display: block;
            font-size: 10px;
            margin: 0 0 3px;
            padding: 4px 5px;
        }
    </style>

While it's convenient to have our form's HTML generated for us, in many
cases you'll want to override the default rendering. ``{{ form.as_table }}``
and friends are useful shortcuts while you develop your application, but
everything about the way a form is displayed can be overridden, mostly within
the template itself, and you'll probably find yourself doing this.

Each field's widget (``<input type="text">``, ``<select>``, ``<textarea>``,
etc.) can be rendered individually by accessing ``{{ form.fieldname }}`` in the
template, and any errors associated with a field are available as
``{{ form.fieldname.errors }}``. With this in mind, we can construct a custom
template for our contact form with the following template code::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Contact us</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Contact us</h1>

        {% if form.errors %}
            <p style="color: red;">
                Please correct the error{{ form.errors|pluralize }} below.
            </p>
        {% endif %}

        <form action="" method="post">
            <div class="field">
                {{ form.subject.errors }}
                <label for="id_subject">Subject:</label>
                {{ form.subject }}
            </div>
            <div class="field">
                {{ form.email.errors }}
                <label for="id_email">Your e-mail address:</label>
                {{ form.email }}
            </div>
            <div class="field">
                {{ form.message.errors }}
                <label for="id_message">Message:</label>
                {{ form.message }}
            </div>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>

``{{ form.message.errors }}`` displays a ``<ul class="errorlist">`` if errors
are present and a blank string if the field is valid (or the form is unbound).
We can also treat ``form.message.errors`` as a Boolean or even iterate
over it as a list. For example::

    <div class="field{% if form.message.errors %} errors{% endif %}">
        {% if form.message.errors %}
            <ul>
            {% for error in form.message.errors %}
                <li><strong>{{ error }}</strong></li>
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        {% endif %}
        <label for="id_message">Message:</label>
        {{ form.message }}
    </div>

In the case of validation errors, this will add an "errors" class to the
containing ``<div>`` and display the list of errors in an unordered list.

What's Next?
============

This chapter concludes the introductory material in this book -- the so-called
"core curriculum." The next section of the book, Chapters 7 to 13, goes into
more detail about advanced Django usage, including how to deploy a Django
application (Chapter 13).

After these first seven chapters, you should know enough to start writing your
own Django projects. The rest of the material in this book will help fill in the
missing pieces as you need them.

We'll start in Chapter 7, by doubling back and taking a closer look at views
and URLconfs (introduced first in Chapter 2).
