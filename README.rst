About this book
===============

You're reading The Django Book, first published in December 2007 (and updated
in 2009) by Apress as The Definitive Guide to Django: Web Development Done
Right.

This Third Edition is a completely revised and updated reference for Django
1.8 Long Term Support (LTS) release. True to the original Apress title, it has
been published as the definitive guide to Django - my principle aim is to
provide a well-written, technical manual, guide and reference to Django.

To retain Adrian and Jacob's original desire for the Django Book to be
accessible as possible, the source code for the Third Edition is
freely available online at https://github.com/big-nige/djangobook.com/third-edition.

This book will be periodically updated to reflect the latest information
available on the Django 1.8LTS release, as well as to incorporate your
suggestions and feedback. Please check the repository for the latest version.

Old files have been maintained at the root directory for reference only - all the updated files are in the 
/third-edition folder.

It is currently a work in progress - everything is in draft at the moment and it is not ready to be used as a learning resource. Watch this space!

Nige' :)
